# 🌐 samOS

Welcome to **samOS** — a Linux-based operating system project!  
Built on top of **Arch Linux** 🐧, samOS comes with its own official kernel and a focus on speed, simplicity, and modern design.

---

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast** – optimized for performance  
- 🏗️ **Arch Linux Base** – rolling release philosophy with flexibility  
- 🎨 **Minimal & Modern Design** – clean UI and user experience  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- The **kernel is not yet fully complete**.  
- For now, samOS is best suited for **testing only**.  
- Please run it inside a **virtual machine** such as:
  - QEMU  
  - VirtualBox  
  - VMware
---

## 🔮 Future Vision
We are actively working on both the **operating system** and its **kernel**.  
Once development reaches completion, samOS will be ready to serve as a **full primary operating system** that you can install directly on your machine 💻.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Head over to the **[Releases](../../releases)** section.  
2. Download the latest samOS build.  
3. Install and run it inside your preferred **virtual machine** (VMware, QEMU, VirtualBox).  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
samOS is **not yet optimized for daily use on real hardware**.  
For now, it is recommended to test samOS only inside a **virtual machine** until the kernel and operating system reach full maturity and become ready for everyday use 🛠️.
